<Tip>
If you find missing nodes when loading the workflow file below, it may be due to the following situations:

1. You are not using the latest Development (Nightly) version of Hanzo Studio.
2. You are using the Stable (Release) version or Desktop version of Hanzo Studio (which does not include the latest feature updates).
3. You are using the latest Commit version of Hanzo Studio, but some nodes failed to import during startup.

Please make sure you have successfully updated Hanzo Studio to the latest Development (Nightly) version. See: [How to Update Hanzo Studio](/installation/update_comfyui) section to learn how to update Hanzo Studio.
