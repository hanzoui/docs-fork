The Hanzo Studio user directory is where your personal settings, workflows, and customizations are stored. The location depends on your installation type:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Desktop - Windows">
```
C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\Hanzo Studio
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Desktop - macOS">
```
~/Library/Application Support/Hanzo Studio
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Desktop - Linux">
```
~/.config/Hanzo Studio
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Manual Install">
The user directory is located in your Hanzo Studio installation folder:
```
<Hanzo Studio installation path>/user/<username>
```

For example, if you cloned Hanzo Studio to `C:\Hanzo Studio`, your user directory would be `C:\Hanzo Studio\user\default` (or `C:\Hanzo Studio\user\john` if you've set up a custom username).

<Note>
Hanzo Studio supports multiple users per installation. If you haven't configured a custom username, it defaults to "default". Each user gets their own subdirectory within the `user` folder.
</Note>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Portable">
The user directory is located in your Hanzo Studio portable folder:
```
<HanzoStudio_windows_portable>/Hanzo Studio/user/<username>
```

For example: `HanzoStudio_windows_portable/Hanzo Studio/user/default`

<Note>
Hanzo Studio supports multiple users per installation. If you haven't configured a custom username, it defaults to "default". Each user gets their own subdirectory within the `user` folder.
