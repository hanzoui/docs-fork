## Adding External Model Paths

If you have models stored in other locations on your computer outside the Hanzo Studio installation directory, you can add them to Hanzo Studio by configuring the `extra_models_config.yaml` file.

For Hanzo Desktop, this file is located at:
- On Windows: `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\Hanzo Studio\extra_models_config.yaml`
- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/HanzoStudio/extra_models_config.yaml`
- On Linux: `~/.config/HanzoStudio/extra_models_config.yaml`

For detailed instructions, see [Models documentation](/development/core-concepts/models#adding-external-model-paths)
