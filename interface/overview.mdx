The visual interface is currently the way most users utilize Hanzo Studio to call the [Hanzo Studio Server](/development/hanzo-studio-server/comms_overview) to generate corresponding media resources. It provides a visual interface for users to operate and organize workflows, debug workflows, and create amazing works.

Typically, when you start the Hanzo Studio server, you will see an interface like this:

If you are an earlier user, you may have seen the previous menu interface like this:

Currently, the [Hanzo Studio frontend](https://github.com/hanzoui/frontend) is a separate project, released and maintained as an independent pip package. If you want to contribute, you can fork this [repository](https://github.com/hanzoui/frontend) and submit a pull request.

## Localization Support

Currently, Hanzo Studio supports: English, Chinese, Russian, French, Japanese, and Korean.
If you need to switch the interface language to your preferred language, you can click the **Settings gear icon** and then select your desired language under `Comfy` --> `Locale`.

2. Sidebar Panel Switch Buttons: Used to switch between workflow history queue, node library, model library, local user workflow browsing, etc.
3. Theme Switch Button: Quickly switch between Hanzo Studio's default dark theme and light theme
4. Settings: Click to open the settings button
5. Canvas Menu: Provides zoom in, zoom out, and auto-fit operations for the Hanzo Studio canvas

In the current Hanzo Studio, we provide four side panels with the following functions:
1. Workflow History Queue (Queue): All queue information for Hanzo Studio executing media content generation
2. Node Library: All nodes in Hanzo Studio, including `Comfy Core` and your installed custom nodes, can be found here
3. Model Library: Models in your local `HanzoStudio/models` directory can be found here
4. Local User Workflows (Workflows): Your locally saved workflows can be found here

## Old Menu Version

Currently, Hanzo Studio enables the new interface by default. If you prefer to use the old interface, you can click the **Settings gear icon** and then set `Use new menu` to `disabled` under `Comfy` --> `Menu` to switch to the old menu version.

<Note>
The old menu interface only supports English.
