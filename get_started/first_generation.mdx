This guide aims to help you understand Hanzo Studio's basic operations and complete your first image generation. We'll cover:

1. Loading example workflows
    - Loading from Hanzo Studio's workflow templates
    - Loading from images with workflow metadata
2. Model installation guidance
    - Automatic model installation
    - Manual model installation
    - Using Hanzo Manager for model installation
3. Completing your first text-to-image generation

## About Text-to-Image

Text-to-Image is a fundamental AI drawing feature that generates images from text descriptions. It's one of the most commonly used functions in AI art generation. You can think of the process as telling your requirements (positive and negative prompts) to an artist (the drawing model), who will then create what you want. Detailed explanations about text-to-image will be covered in the [Text to Image](/tutorials/basic/text-to-image) chapter.

## Hanzo Studio Text-to-Image Workflow Tutorial

### 1. Launch Hanzo Studio

Make sure you've followed the installation guide to start Hanzo Studio and can successfully enter the Hanzo Studio interface.

If you have not installed Hanzo Studio, please choose a suitable version to install based on your device.

### 2. Load Default Text-to-Image Workflow

Hanzo Studio usually loads the default text-to-image workflow automatically when launched. However, you can try different methods to load workflows to familiarize yourself with Hanzo Studio's basic operations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Load from Workflow Template">
  ![Hanzo Studio Interface](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-1.jpg)
  Follow the numbered steps in the image:
  1. Click the **Fit View** button in the bottom right to ensure any loaded workflow isn't hidden
  2. Click the **folder icon (workflows)** in the sidebar
  3. Click the **Browse example workflows** button at the top of the Workflows panel

  Continue with:
  ![Load Workflow](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-2-load-workflow.jpg)

  4. Select the first default workflow **Image Generation** to load it

  Alternatively, you can select **Browse workflow templates** from the workflow menu
  ![Hanzo Studio Menu - Browse Workflow Templates](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-1-menu.jpg)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Load from Images with Metadata">
  All images generated by Hanzo Studio contain metadata including workflow information. You can load workflows by:
  - Dragging and dropping a HanzoStudio-generated image into the interface
  - Using menu **Workflows** -> **Open** to open an image

  Try loading the workflow using this example image:
  ![HanzoStudio-Text to Image Workflow](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/text-to-image-workflow.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Load from workflow.json">
  Hanzo Studio workflows can be stored in JSON format. You can export workflows using menu **Workflows** -> **Export**.

  Try downloading and loading this example workflow:
  <a className="prose" href="https://github.com/hanzoui/docs/blob/main/public/text-to-image.json" download style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
    <p className="prose" style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>Download text-to-image.json</p>
  </a>

  After downloading, use menu **Workflows** -> **Open** to load the JSON file.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Model Installation

Most Hanzo Studio installations don't include base models by default. After loading the workflow, if you don't have the [v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/hanzoui/stable-diffusion-v1-5-archive/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors) model installed, you'll see this prompt:

![Missing Models](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-3-missing-models.jpg)

All models are stored in `<your Hanzo Studio installation>/HanzoStudio/models/` with subfolders like `checkpoints`, `embeddings`, `vae`, `lora`, `upscale_model`, etc. Hanzo Studio detects models in these folders and paths configured in `extra_model_paths.yaml` at startup.

![Hanzo Studio Models Folder](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-models-folder.jpg)

You can install models through:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic Download">
  After you click the **Download** button, Hanzo Studio will execute the download, and different behaviors will be performed depending on the version you are using.
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Hanzo Desktop">

    The desktop version will automatically complete the model download and save it to the `<your Hanzo Studio installation location>/HanzoStudio/models/checkpoints` directory.
    You can wait for the installation to complete or view the installation progress in the model panel on the sidebar.

    ![Model Download Progress](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-download-status.jpg)

    If everything goes smoothly, the model should be able to download locally. If the download fails for a long time, please try other installation methods.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Hanzo Studio Portable">

    The browser will execute file downloads. Please save the file to the `<your Hanzo Studio installation location>/HanzoStudio_windows_portable/HanzoStudio/models/checkpoints` directory after the download is complete.
    
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hanzo Manager">
  Hanzo Manager is a tool for managing custom nodes, models, and plugins.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open Hanzo Manager">
      ![Hanzo Manager Installation](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-hanzo-studio-manager.jpg)
      
      Click the `Manager` button to open Hanzo Manager
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open Model Manager">
      ![Hanzo Manager Model Management](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-hanzo-studio-manager-model-manager.jpg)
      
      Click `Model Manager`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Search and Install Model">
      ![Hanzo Manager Model Download](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-hanzo-studio-manager-download-model.jpg)
      
      1. Search for `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt`
      2. Click `install` on the desired model
    </Step>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual Installation">
  Visit [v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/hanzoui/stable-diffusion-v1-5-archive/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors) and follow this guide:

  ![Hugging Face Model Download](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-5-hugging-face.jpg)

  Save the downloaded file to:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Hanzo Desktop">
      Save to `<your Hanzo Studio installation>/HanzoStudio/models/checkpoints`

      ![Hanzo Desktop Model Save Location](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-6-2-desktop.jpg)
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Hanzo Studio Portable">
      Save to `HanzoStudio_windows_portable/HanzoStudio/models/checkpoints`

### 4. Load Model and Generate Your First Image

After installing the model:

![Image Generation](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-7-queue.jpg)
