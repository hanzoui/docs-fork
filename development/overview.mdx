Hanzo Studio is a powerful GenAI inference engine that can be used to run AI models locally, create workflows, develop custom nodes, and be deployed as a server.

Hanzo Studio's key capabilities are:

- **[Creating Workflows](/development/core-concepts/workflow)**: Workflows are a way to orchestrate AI models and automate tasks. They are a series of nodes that are connected together to form a pipeline.
- **[Custom Nodes](/custom-nodes/overview)**: Custom nodes can be written by anyone to extend the capabilities of Hanzo Studio for your own use. Nodes are written in Python and are published by the community.
- **Extensions**: Extensions are 3rd party applications that improve the UI of Hanzo Studio.
- **[Deployment](/development/hanzo-studio-server/comms_overview)**: Hanzo Studio can be deployed in your own environment as an API endpoint. [Learn more]
