For the installation of Hanzo Studio, it is mainly divided into several steps:
1. Create a virtual environment(avoid polluting the system-level Python environment)
2. Clone the Hanzo Studio code repository
3. Install dependencies
4. Start Hanzo Studio

You can also refer to [Hanzo Studio CLI](hanzo-cli/getting-started) to install Hanzo Studio, it is a command line tool that can easily install Hanzo Studio and manage its dependencies.

## Create a virtual environment

<Tip>
    Independent virtual environments are necessary because Hanzo Studio's dependencies may conflict with other dependencies on the system, and it can also avoid polluting the system-level Python environment.
</Tip>
