**Hanzo Desktop** is a standalone installation version that can be installed like regular software. It supports quick installation and automatic configuration of the **Python environment and dependencies**, and supports one-click import of existing Hanzo Studio settings, models, workflows, and files. You can quickly migrate from an existing [Hanzo Studio Portable version](/installation/hanzo_studio_portable_windows) to the Desktop version.

Hanzo Desktop is an open source project, please visit the full code [here](https://github.com/hanzoui/desktop)

Hanzo Desktop hardware requirements:

  ![Hanzo Studio Installation Steps - GPU Selection](/images/desktop/win-hanzo-studio-desktop-2.jpg)

   The three options are:
   1. **Nvidia GPU (Recommended):** Direct support for pytorch and CUDA
   2. **Manual Configuration:** You need to manually install and configure the python runtime environment. Don't select this unless you know how to configure
   3. **Enable CPU Mode:** For developers and special cases only. Don't select this unless you're sure you need it
    
    Unless there are special circumstances, please select **NVIDIA** as shown and click **Next** to proceed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install location">
  ![Hanzo Studio Installation Steps - Installation Location](/images/desktop/win-hanzo-studio-desktop-3.jpg)

   In this step, you will select the installation location for the following Hanzo Studio content:
  - **Python Environment**
  - **Models Model Files**
  - **Custom Nodes Custom Nodes**

  Recommendations:
  - Please select a **solid-state drive** as the installation location, which will increase Hanzo Studio's performance when accessing models.
  - Please create a separate empty folder as the Hanzo Studio installation directory
  - Please ensure that the corresponding disk has at least around **15G** of disk space to ensure the installation of Hanzo Desktop
  
  <Note>Not all files are installed in this directory, some files will still be installed on the C drive, and if you need to uninstall in the future, you can refer to the uninstallation section of this guide to complete the full uninstallation of Hanzo Desktop</Note>

  After completing this step, click **Next** to proceed to the next step

  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate from Existing Installation (Optional)">
  ![Hanzo Studio Installation Steps - File Migration](/images/desktop/win-hanzo-studio-desktop-4.jpg)

  In this step you can migrate your existing Hanzo Studio installation content to Hanzo Desktop. As shown, I selected my original **D:\HanzoStudio_windows_portable\Hanzo Studio** installation directory. The installer will automatically recognize:
  - **User Files**
  - **Models:** Will not be copied, only linked with desktop version
  - **Custom Nodes:** Nodes will be reinstalled

  Don't worry, this step won't copy model files. You can check or uncheck options as needed. Click **Next** to continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop Settings">
  ![Hanzo Studio Installation Steps - Desktop Settings](/images/desktop/win-hanzo-studio-desktop-5.jpg)

   These are preference settings:
   1. **Automatic Updates:** Whether to set automatic updates when Hanzo Studio updates are available
   2. **Usage Metrics:** If enabled, we will collect **anonymous usage data** to help improve Hanzo Studio
   3. **Mirror Settings:** Since the program needs internet access to download Python and complete environment installation, if you see a red ❌ during installation indicating this may cause installation failure, please follow the steps below

   ![Hanzo Studio Installation Steps - Mirror Settings](/images/desktop/win-hanzo-studio-desktop-6.jpg)
   Expand the mirror settings to find the specific failing mirror. In this screenshot the error is **Python Install Mirror** failure.

## Troubleshooting

### Display unsupported devices

![Hanzo Studio Installation Steps - Unsupported Device](/images/desktop/win-hanzo-studio-desktop-0.jpg)

Since Hanzo Desktop (Windows) only supports **NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA**, you may see this screen if your device is not supported
- Please switch to a supported device
- Or consider using [Hanzo Studio Portable](/installation/hanzo_studio_portable_windows) or through [manual installation](/installation/manual_install) to use Hanzo Studio
